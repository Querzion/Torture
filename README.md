#   TORTURE - PHYSICAL KEYBOARD / LAYOUT

This is a impulsive project. 
    It's for a keyboard, with a inconsiderate layout. I will call it torture, 
    because it will take probably a little more time to  learn then it took me to learn Svorak-A1. 
    Torture has it's own physical layout which changes the functionality of a keyboard. It's meant to be smaller, 
    but not less effective. It still has everything that is needed. It's going to be based on Svorak-A5, 
    so if someone needs to have another physical layout, then I might need other people to give of their
    time and help out with the 'project', you can't really call it that, it's an impulsive idea, yet... 
    I really want to make it happen. 

Why the name torture? Well, it took me a little less then a month to train my muscle memory when it comes to using Svorak-A1, and now I'm thinking of actually making a keyboard that is based on Svorak-A5, and has a different physical layout alltogether. 

There are always problems when it comes to projects, but here's a list of mine:
    
    3D Design - I can't do it. I don't know how to use blender or software like it.
    
    PCB Design - Sure I know how a PCB works, but I'm not an electrical engineer. 
    
    Money - Things cost money. I need money, so that I can take the project to a higher level.
    
    Software & Drivers - Sure I'm learning programming as we speak, but It's the wrong language (C#).
      It's probably C or some other language that is needed to create the driver, and I want it 
      to be Linux compatible from the get go. Why? Because I daily drive a derrivative of Arch.
    
    Where to start? I have no Idea. So what's the features? 
      I want the Keyboard to have at least 2 USB-A connectors or USB-C, but it might not be possible...
      Why? Because I want it to be wireless, that's why, but whichever floats the boat is probably best. 
      RGB, with controllable colours, not just cycling of pre-ordained programs. If I want white light, 
      or a specific green or red, or blue, then it's there to be controlled. It also needs to be 
      hot-swappable mechanical switches. It's supposed to be easy to fix it if it breaks. It's probably 
      already expensive enough as it is in pre-production, and in production....

    I was thinking ... After the Visualisation; that I kind of created earlier today. TADA! »

    First » Create a physical version. A keyboard case that is 3D printed or something...
      Oh yeah... I don't have a 3D printer, nor do I know how to use one or design something in a 3D 
      application. However a physical version, so that it can be 'tested' before a PCB is created.
    
    Second » Create a PCB design that works with the case.... Shouldn't be too difficult when
      there's a bunch of designs already in existence... Probably.

    
    Third » Create a driver.... It should be easy. Right?
    
    Fourth » Create a software, that is ported to Linux, Windows & MacOS.
      Here I'm actually thinking, that I want to fix a problem that very few people have... 
      If I install a Linux Distro and chose Language: Swedish » Layout: Swedish Dvorak, in the installation; 
      then I can't play games if I don't also install Swedish » Swedish Default and switch to it prior to 
      starting a game. It would be nice to have the layout in the keyboard, and a translation layer to the 
      computer. Like a DXVK to be blunt. I use Swedish Dvorak, but my computer thinks I use Swedish Default.
      Which means All and every damn layout can be programmed to the keyboard, and you just connect it to
      any whichever operating system and it works. I have had a lot of problems with installations of layouts
      in both Linux and Windows. Mostly at boot up, where it's one, and when you log in, it's another.
      
      I JUST GOT AN IDEA! The side scroll! What If I combine it with a small display, that have a very easy menu... 
      I'm thinking, wouldn't it be nice to maybe change the colour of the keyboard with the side scroll?
      Pushing down the Function key, then having two or three buttons on the side of the keyboard. 
      with them you choose 'Backwards' & 'Forwards/OK', and you change a HEX code to have at least one colour.
      
    Fifth » Marketing?! / Kickstarter... Should I start that before and try to get lots of money to start a company
      and pay others to help me make this a reality? Is it too niche to take off? 


YES! Layouts. I have been naming names, but not everyone knows what Swedish Dvorak looks like. 
These here are Svorak-A1 & Svorak-A5. There is a third called Svorak-A6, but it's mainly used in MacOS only.
I currently use A1, but because I don't have the numbers in a good position for the TORTURE layout, it's probably
a better idea to kind of using A5 for the keycaps etc.

(Nothing that I really mentioned, but it's never the less a layout that people use).

EDIT - 2023OCT01
It's come to my interest that I would like to add a touchpad in the place where the numpad usually is situated, 
with three buttons underneath and the volume wheel above it, possibly having even more then one knob, for multi-purpose usage.
